    down you notice there are two doors, one to your left and one to your right.
    The door to your left it barred down with wooden planks. The door to your right
    seems like a regular door painted white with red stripes. Also, you can see something
    down the hallway but cannot quite make up what it is. It seems like a curtain
    hanging from a ceiling.

    barred door

    3. Try to white door
